# RISC-V Processor

### Description
* Homework for the Computer Architecture course.
* The project aimed the implementation of a RISC-V processor that can perform operations in 5 pipeline stages (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) with the help of instruction memory, registers, an arithmetic logic unit, data memory, a hazard detection unit and a forwarding unit.


### Languages
* The project was fully built using Verilog.
